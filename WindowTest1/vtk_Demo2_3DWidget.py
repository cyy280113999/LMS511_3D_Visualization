    # Next we create an instance of vtkConeSource and set some of its
    # properties. The instance of vtkConeSource 'cone' is part of a
    # visualization pipeline (it is a source process object) it produces data
    # (output type is vtkPolyData) which other filters may process.
    #
    cone = vtk.vtkConeSource()
    cone.SetHeight(3.0)
    cone.SetRadius(1.0)
    cone.SetResolution(10)

    #
    # In this example we terminate the pipeline with a mapper process object.
    # (Intermediate filters such as vtkShrinkPolyData could be inserted in
    # between the source and the mapper.)  We create an instance of
    # vtkPolyDataMapper to map the polygonal data into graphics primitives. We
    # connect the output of the cone source to the input of this mapper.
    #
    coneMapper = vtk.vtkPolyDataMapper()
    coneMapper.SetInputConnection(cone.GetOutputPort())

    #
    # Create an actor to represent the cone. The actor orchestrates rendering
    # of the mapper's graphics primitives. An actor also refers to properties
    # via a vtkProperty instance, and includes an internal transformation
    # matrix. We set this actor's mapper to be coneMapper which we created
    # above.
    #
    coneActor = vtk.vtkActor()
    coneActor.SetMapper(coneMapper)
    coneActor.GetProperty().SetColor(colors.GetColor3d('Bisque'))

    #
    # Create the Renderer and assign actors to it. A renderer is like a
    # viewport. It is part or all of a window on the screen and it is
    # responsible for drawing the actors it has.  We also set the background
    # color here.
    #
    ren1 = vtk.vtkRenderer()
    ren1.AddActor(coneActor)
    ren1.SetBackground(colors.GetColor3d('MidnightBlue'))

    #
    # Finally we create the render window which will show up on the screen.
    # We put our renderer into the render window using AddRenderer. We also
    # set the size to be 300 pixels by 300.
    #
    renWin = vtk.vtkRenderWindow()
    renWin.AddRenderer(ren1)

    #
    # The vtkRenderWindowInteractor class watches for events (e.g., keypress,
    # mouse) in the vtkRenderWindow. These events are translated into
    # event invocations that VTK understands (see VTK/Common/vtkCommand.h
    # for all events that VTK processes). Then observers of these VTK
    # events can process them as appropriate.
    iren = vtk.vtkRenderWindowInteractor()
    iren.SetRenderWindow(renWin)

    #
    # By default the vtkRenderWindowInteractor instantiates an instance
    # of vtkInteractorStyle. vtkInteractorStyle translates a set of events
    # it observes into operations on the camera, actors, and/or properties
    # in the vtkRenderWindow associated with the vtkRenderWinodwInteractor.
    # Here we specify a particular interactor style.
    style = vtk.vtkInteractorStyleTrackballCamera()
    iren.SetInteractorStyle(style)

    #
    # Here we use a vtkBoxWidget to transform the underlying coneActor (by
    # manipulating its transformation matrix). Many other types of widgets
    # are available for use, see the documentation for more details.
    #
    # The SetInteractor method is how 3D widgets are associated with the render
    # window interactor. Internally, SetInteractor sets up a bunch of callbacks
    # using the Command/Observer mechanism (AddObserver()). The place factor
    # controls the initial size of the widget with respect to the bounding box
    # of the input to the widget.
    boxWidget = vtk.vtkBoxWidget()
    boxWidget.SetInteractor(iren)
    boxWidget.SetPlaceFactor(1.25)
    boxWidget.GetOutlineProperty().SetColor(colors.GetColor3d('Gold'))

    #
    # Place the interactor initially. The input to a 3D widget is used to
    # initially position and scale the widget. The EndInteractionEvent is
    # observed which invokes the SelectPolygons callback.
    #
    boxWidget.SetProp3D(coneActor)
    boxWidget.PlaceWidget()
    callback = vtkMyCallback()
    boxWidget.AddObserver('InteractionEvent', callback)

    #
    # Normally the user presses the 'i' key to bring a 3D widget to life. Here
    # we will manually enable it so it appears with the cone.
